                                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall first be attempted to be resolved through good-faith negotiation.
                                </p>
                                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    If negotiation fails, you and wollanda agree to resolve any dispute through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Wilmington, Delaware, and shall be conducted in English. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                                </p>
                                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm pending the completion of arbitration. You agree that any claims must be brought in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
                                </p>
